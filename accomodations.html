          Accommodations in Iceland range from budget-friendly hostels to luxury hotels. Whether you are on a budget or have a large group, 
          there is going to be something for you. I personally went with an Airbnb in Reykjavik because of the location, privacy, convenience, and long-stay discount. 
          It was easy to have a central location and drive to all the sights we wanted to see.
          Reykjavik, the capital city, has the largest selection of accommodations in Iceland, including hotels, hostels, guesthouses, and apartments. There are also many options for accommodations outside of Reykjavik, including in rural areas and small towns.
          <br>Here are some popular types of accommodations in Iceland:
