        <p>Many people believe that flying to Iceland is very expensive. Your cost will vary depending on where you are departing from and what season 
          you choose to visit.  Although it was the most single expensive cost during my trip, you can get cheaper flights during Icelandâ€™s tourist off-season. I chose to visit during September and my 2-way flight cost a little over $900 USD. 
          There were tickets as low as $630. I suggest that you plan ahead to get the best deals.

        <p>Iceland's main international airport is Keflavik International Airport (KEF), located about 50 kilometers southwest of the capital city, Reykjavik. 
          Keflavik International Airport is well connected to many major cities in North America, Europe, and Asia, with airlines such as Icelandair, Delta, and United with regular flights to and from the airport. 
          The airport has modern facilities, including restaurants, cafes, duty-free shopping, and car rental services. If you drink alcohol, the airport is the best place to purcahse drinks as they are duty-free and much cheaper than if you were to purchase once you enter the country.</p>

        <p> There are a few ways to travel around Iceland. Whether you prefer the independence of driving yourself or the structure of going on guided tours, there is a way to make the most of your trip. You should research thoroughly and choose the option that best suits your needs and preferences. I personally chose to rent from Blue Car Rental as they were convenient and affordable for me.

            <dd>Car rentals in Iceland are widely available, and renting a car gives visitors the freedom to explore the country at their own pace. Most car rental companies offer a range of vehicles, from small and economical to large and rugged 4x4s suitable for Iceland's rugged terrain. It is important to note 
              that driving in Iceland can be challenging due to the country's changeable weather, narrow roads, and unpredictable road conditions, so visitors should take precautions and drive carefully. Be sure to get adequate insurance coverage to avoid any high repair costs that may occur.</dd>
