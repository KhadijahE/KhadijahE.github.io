        <p>Iceland offers a wide variety of activities and attractions for people to explore. From marveling at natural wonders like waterfalls and geysers, 
          to soaking in geothermal hot springs, to hiking on glaciers and exploring lava tunnels, Iceland offers something for everyone. You can also enjoy cultural experiences in Reykjavik and explore the city. 
          Here are some of the most popular activities that I though were fun to explore!

        <p>The Golden Circle is one of Iceland's most popular tourist routes, offering visitors a chance to explore some of the country's most iconic natural wonders. The route typically includes three main stops: the Geysir geothermal area, Gullfoss waterfall, and Thingvellir National Park.
          <dl>
            <dt><strong><a href="https://www.thingvellir.is/en/" target="_blank">Thingvellir National:</a></strong></dt>
            <dd>Thingvellir National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the site of Iceland's first parliament, established in 930 AD. The park is also where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet, creating a rift valley that visitors can walk through. Thingvellir is also home to stunning vistas and hiking trails.</dd>
            <dt><strong><a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/gullfoss" target="_blank">Gullfoss waterfall:</a></strong></dt>
            <dd>Gullfoss waterfall, known as the "Golden Waterfall," is one of Iceland's most impressive waterfalls, cascading down two tiers into a deep canyon. Visitors can take a short walk to the edge of the waterfall, feeling the spray on their faces and marveling at the power of nature.</dd>
            <dt><strong><a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/connect-with-locals/regina/the-extraordinary-geysir-geothermal-area-strokkur-and-all-the-other-hot-pots-in-south-iceland" target="_blank">Geysir geothermal area:</a></strong></dt>
            <dd>The Geysir geothermal area features hot springs and geysers, including the famous Strokkur geyser, which erupts every few minutes, shooting boiling water up to 30 meters into the air. Visitors can walk around the geothermal area, taking in the sights and smells of the bubbling mud pools and steam vents.</dd>
        
          </dl>
          </p>
          <p>Although I was unable to visit Gulfoss waterfall and the Geysir, Thingvellir national Park was a lovely stop. I would highly suggest that you plan a day to visit all three stops so you don't miss out!</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.skylagoon.com/" target="_blank">Sky Lagoon</a> and <a href="https://www.bluelagoon.com/" target="_blank">Blue Lagoon</a> are two popular geothermal spas in Iceland.
          The Blue Lagoon, which is considered the most popular, is a large, man-made lagoon and is one of Iceland's most iconic tourist attractions. It features warm, turquoise waters surrounded by a stunning volcanic landscape. The Sky Lagoon, on the other hand, is a relatively new addition to Iceland's geothermal spa scene. It is located in the town of Kársnes, near Reykjavik, and offers a unique, elevated spa experience. Both lagoons are popular tourist destinations and offer a relaxing and rejuvenating experience. Ultimately, the choice between the Sky Lagoon and Blue Lagoon will depend on personal preferences and what you are looking for in a spa experience. I personally enjoyed my time at the Sky Lagoon and will visit the Blue Lagoon on my next visit!

        <p>Iceland's <a href="https://thelavatunnel.is/lava-tunnel/" target="_blank">lava tunnels</a> are natural underground caves that were formed by lava flows thousands of years ago. 
          The Lava Tunnel is one of the most popular lava tunnels in Iceland and is open year-round for guided tours. The tunnel is over 1,000 meters long and features impressive rock formations, 
          colorful mineral deposits, and other geological features that were formed by the lava. During the tour, visitors can learn about the geological history of Iceland, the formation of the lava tunnels, 
          and the various uses that the tunnels have had over the centuries. The tour also includes the opportunity to see a section of the tunnel that is lit up with colorful LED lights, creating an otherworldly atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>The Lava Tunnel is suitable for all ages and abilities, although visitors should be aware that the tunnel can be uneven and slippery in places, so sturdy shoes are recommended. There is a shorter 1-hour tour that is beginner friendly 
          and a more immersive 4-hour tour that takes you deeper into the cave. Overall, a visit to Iceland's lava tunnels is a fascinating and memorable experience that offers a unique glimpse into Iceland's volcanic past.
