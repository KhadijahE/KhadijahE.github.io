        <p>Grocery stores in Iceland, provide citizens and visitors with a variety of food and household items. 
          Although Iceland is notorious for high prices, grocery stores provide an extremely affordable option to stock up on essentials. 
          Reykjavik, being the largest city and capital of Iceland, has a number of large chain supermarkets and smaller, locally-owned stores to choose from. 
          Whether you are shopping for ingredients for a home-cooked meal or for everyday essentials, grocery stores in Reykjavik offer a wide selection of both locally-sourced and imported products. 
          I made sure to get groceries so I could make lunch and breakfast on certain days instead of eating at restaurants. Just make sure to check the opening hours of grocery stores as some have limited 
          hours in comparison to what you may be used to in the United States.
