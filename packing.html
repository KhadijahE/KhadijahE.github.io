        <h2>Packing List</h2>
        <p>Figuring out what you need to pack can make traveling more stressful, 
          but it is necessary if you’ll want less stress during your trip. Having a 
          detailed list can give you peace of mind knowing that you have everything you need for your trip.
        </p>  
        <p>The list I have created is not meant to be comprehensive but is meant to give you a general idea of 
          what may be helpful to bring. Make sure you do all of your own research to see what will be best for your 
          trip based on the season you will travel and the activities you choose to participate in. Here’s what I found helpful during my own excursions!
          <dl>
            <dt><strong>Layered Clothing:</strong></dt>
            <dd>Iceland is typically a cold country, so it's important to bring many different types of thermal clothing such as layered shirts, jackets, pants, leggings, socks, and gloves. Make sure to pack a hat and scarf but you can also purchase them once you land.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Waterproof Jacket, Pants, & Shoes:</strong></dt>
            <dd>You want to be prepared for Iceland’s weather, but you’ll also want to have waterproof clothes if you are visiting waterfalls. </dd>
            <dt><strong>Hiking Boots:</strong></dt>
            <dd>Iceland has many great hiking and walking spots so bring a comfortable sturdy pair of hiking boots. I would also recommend that these be waterproof if possible.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Swimsuit:</strong></dt>
            <dd>You’ll want a comfortable swimsuit if you plan on visiting Iceland’s many natural hot springs, geothermal pools, or spas. </dd>
            <dt><strong>Power Adapter:</strong></dt>
            <dd>Iceland uses Type F power plugs, so make sure to bring a power adapter if you're coming from a country that uses a different type of plug.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Portable Charger:</strong></dt>
            <dd>Although not a necessity, I found having a portable phone charger helpful on long excursions and site seeing. </dd>
            <dt><strong>Travel Documents:</strong></dt>
            <dd>Don't forget your passport, travel insurance, and any necessary visas. It’s helpful to have them organized in a pouch or bag as well.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Waterproof Phone Pouch:</strong></dt>
            <dd>A waterproof phone pouch will be extremely necessary if you visit places like the Sky Lagoon and many waterfalls.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Backpack:</strong></dt>
            <dd>A sturdy water-resistant backpack is useful for carrying your essentials while exploring.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Water Bottle:</strong></dt>
            <dd>Iceland has some of the cleanest tap water you’ll find so it is a good idea to invest in a water bottle. Just remember not to be put off by the sulfuric smell.</dd>
